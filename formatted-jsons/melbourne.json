But I'm not sure where to donate anything else.\n\n I don't want to donate to some organisation that is actually ineffective or exploitative. My partner occasionally has donated clothes to those metal boxes on the street by the train station because he apparently doesn't want the clothes to go to Salvos to be sold at over-inflated prices* to \"hipsters\" (his words). But I'm not sure he actually knows where the items in those boxes go either. I've tried to give some stuff away to Facebook groups but sometimes people aren't good at communicating and meeting up, even for free stuff.\n\n**Where would you donate:**\n\n* Clothes\n* Household items (kitchen tools, plates and glasses, office supplies, things like that)\n* Furniture\n* Unopened and unexpired non-perishable food\n* Unopened and unexpired Toiletries (shampoo, soap, makeup, etc)\n* Any other goods\n\nYou don't have to give suggestions just for me - let's make a list that would be informative for anyone in Melbourne.\n\n\n**Salvos prices: honestly I'm with him on this. I've seen shabby condition stuff sold at Salvos for like more than the new thing would cost at Kmart. I'm from the US and all the op-shops I would go to would sell stuff for like 10 cents but a lot of stuff at Salvos seems to have the price of $2.25 or some other awkward number that doesn't seem to reflect any actual consideration of it's value.*",

However they don't apparently support this item after we spoke to them today. Bit lost on how to approach this now. \n\nIdeally we'd like to try minimise costs if possible through Medicare etc but at the same time not wait too long, more important to get treatment and see someone sooner rather than later.\n\nI'd be open to suggestions as well for private health insurance as this is something we're seriously considering to take up to help with mental health treatments, costs, and wait time for SO.\n\nPlease feel free to pm me too if you have experience with a psychiatrist who specialises in bipolar disorder :)\n\nThanks\n\nEdit 1 - should mention were based in the southeast/bayside areas so preferably someone/somewhere that's either in these areas or the eastern suburbs or cbd/inner suburbs (Richmond St kilda Rd etc) area would be great :) ",
