The official website has the full listings, with time / location / artist, and genres for each venue.\n\nhttp://parramattalanes.com.au/\n\nSince there's at least 12 playing each night across 8 venues, and most of them are local or smaller acts, I looked them up to help decide which to go to. In case anyone else has the same dilemma, the below link is to a spreadsheet with 24 of the artists' venue, time, website / SoundCloud / etc, and my humble opinion of their style and which are the best by ranking A (4) / B (8) / C (12).\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTKph5mNzIu2SIzeNyqxLKyEaEMTYFBAoH3ml5ENbiQ4UbjLwXPbGKexLwxFncxk5ye-o5I9GxV1aEo/pubhtml\n\nThere were few that I couldn't find anything on or if I did I just wasn't that interested in (most of QNE ones), so it's not totally complete, but if anyone has extra info please comment.\n\nLastly, here's a track from each of my \"A\" picks:\n\nSlim Set - Cooked: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lstJrP00dQ\n\nMilan Ring - Drifting: https://soundcloud.com/milanring/drifting-1\n\nClarissa Mei - Vulnerable: https://www.triplejunearthed.com/jukebox/play/track/6812316\n\nSila - BYM: https://www.triplejunearthed.com/jukebox/play/track/7367076",

As such, could someone with a bit more know-how than me kindly advise the following:\n\n1. Are there any good contractors anyone would recommend that could use plaster/putty to repair the area?\n2. I'm a renter, and I'll be informing my real estate agent of the damage. Am I correct in assuming that this sort of accident is not covered by fair wear and tear?\n\nAppreciate any advice.",

No need to bring plates or mugs, but bring whatever you'd like to have or share. I'm sponsoring the rental for this first get-together so you don't even need a gold coin. I'll bring a fairly decent bluetooth speaker so bring your music. If folks want to go out clubbing afterwards, great. I thought with the 4-8 timeframe we can get people who may have to get home to put kids to bed, as well as people who may work during the day or night on Saturday.\n\nI am happy to respond to any PM's and we can put together a group one if that seems to make more sense. If people wanted to plan the potluck so that we end up with a somewhat organised full meal, that would be okay too. Lots of places to pick up grub & grog at the nearby Broadway shopping centre.\n\nAlso, happy to give my mobile via PM so folks have someone to ring on the day if they get lost.",

At the same time, I've read online of people paying roughly $1500 for the whole procedure.\n\nWhat can I do to reduce this\n\nAll hospitals quoted me $1900 - $2400.  The hospitals I called were provided to me by the surgeon. I tried to contact a public hospital and their charge for the anesthetist is $250 per hour (I need 30 mins, and around $350 a day for the room....\n\nThat's a saving of nearly $3000.....\n\nIs this normal?
