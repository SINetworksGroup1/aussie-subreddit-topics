I tested the waters and asked about it under the guise that my wife may move down sooner than expected, what do we do, oh and ps we have a cat. Even offering more bond they said no dice, which actually was very surprising.\n\nMy conundrum is this. I have a six month lease, I have just done the first inspection, have one more in three months until the lease is up, so I can easily hide all evidence for that. \n\nI worry my neighbour may snitch though. Now this can go one of two ways, they had the property on the market for a while before i took it, I pay my rent on time, and I am a great tenant (excluding the contraband cat plan). They may look past it, but the body corp also has a no pets without permission policy (it is a 70s era flat, wtf!). If they give me notice I dont mind too much, my lease is up in January, I was never going to renew, and if I object to the notice and go to Court over it I doubt it would resolve by then anyway lol.\n\n**my real question** is how strict are body corps and agents down here on this? Is it going to a situation where a neighbour says something and they will go all guns blazing, or will they let it slide a bit? I know in Victoria in the past they would generally let it slide unless you were causing damage or other problems (now they passed laws where you cant say no pets). I have no real idea what agents are like down here. If it happens in a couple of months then that is easier for me, I doubt we would get in front of a magi right away, I will adjourn it a couple of times, and frankly I doubt they would want to spend fees on it when I have a couple of months on the lease anyway. \n\n**TL;DR:** How quickly will I get notice to vacate once I get a cat...",

You must be over the age of 18 to participate. You must never have experienced anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) following a previous dose of an influenza vaccine or been advised not to have the vaccine for reasons of allergy by a medical professional.\n\nParticipation is entirely voluntary and you may withdraw from the study at any time before the submission of the survey.\n\nThe survey will take around 20 minutes to complete.\n\nResponses are anonymous.\n\nFor more information and to participate:\n\n[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/V85ZLHJ](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/V85ZLHJ)\n\nThank you!\n\n(If there is any issue with posting this here, please accept my apologies and remove it).",

I've done most of the east coast of Australia and nowhere compares to Hobart.\n\nNext time I'm visiting MONA (ran out of time), heading out to Port Arthur and surrounds, and definitely out to Strathgordon.
