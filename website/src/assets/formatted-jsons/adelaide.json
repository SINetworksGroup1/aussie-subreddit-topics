      "body":"28 M from Wales here. I grew up with my childhood friends staying up until 1am to watch every wwe and tna ppv and watching Raw and Smackdown every weekend. Then when I moved to University I made 6 friends who loved wrestling as much as me and for 3 years I we watched Raw live at 1 every Monday and again every ppv. When I was 24 I moved to Canada and straight away met 3 guys who loved it and we would watch every ppv at 5pm together.  I moved here September 2017 and so far I have made friends to do things that involve all of my hobbies and interests apart from Wrestling. I just came back from the super show down in Melbourne and the plane there and back were full of people in wrestling t-shirts but I wasn't sitting next to anyone wearing one to fire up a conversation. I have been to every world series of wrestling show that has been here, A wrestle rampage shows at fowlers with work people who fancied something different  and the NJPW event. There were so many guys sitting by themselves in the back row of these world series shows who just like me have probably just moved here and can't find anybody to watch these events with. I went to Mick Foley's 20 years of hell tour the first show and in the back 5 rows it just seemed to go one person,empty seat,person,empty seat. So I know there's plenty of us here who have no one to go to these events with. Coming up in the next month or so  we have 3 wwe ppvs on a Monday morning to watch, Fozzy live, Lucha Libre show at HQ complex, all the local companies like riot city and rampage have shows on so instead of going alone let's make friends over a suplex. Guys,girls,every gender, young,old,cool or nerd hit me up",
