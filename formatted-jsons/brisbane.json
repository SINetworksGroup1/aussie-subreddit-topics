      "body":"With fuel prices the way they are, I thought I would do a nice AMA and answer anyone's questions. As it breaks my company's policy to disclose/discuss fuel prices and procedures I will not say for which company I work for.\n\nFAQ:\n\nWhy did you set the fuel price so high? I can get it cheaper from *x*\n\n* As is the case for *most* fuel stations, franchise or corporate, store management has zero control over fuel prices. Whoever the big guys upstairs are, they care about numbers - so buy at a lower price if you see it and only buy it when it's expensive if you have to and in small amounts if you can. We aren't actually told why the fuel prices are so high, but it's public knowledge that the oil price and AUD rate has something to do with it, as well as supply and demand.\n\nWhat happens when the price changes?\n\n* As is the case for most companies that I know of, fuel prices arrive on the POS (point of sale computer) and present the attendant with two options, Accept or Wait. The wait button is to ask for more time to change the price boards or wait until the forecourt is clear in case pumps freeze up when the new price is accepted. You can *only* snooze for up to about 25 minutes, at which point the option to snooze is gone and you must accept the new price. This is why mishaps like [this](https://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/traffic-reports/cheap-999-cents-a-litre-fuel-at-new-coomera-shell-petrol-station-on-gold-coast/news-story/b52685f308593e177da576492b1f72d6?nk=30021df398b390641010c652fbbdf549-1539138096) can happen when there's an error.\n\nDo you get cheap fuel/know when the price is going to change?\n\n* The only way we would know fuel prices are going up is when someone who works at a different store has their price change first. If we know it's coming we might tell you, but most of the time we don't know when or by how much.\n\n\nI've copped a lot of abuse on shift since the price went up on Saturday, granted that crowd probably doesn't browse Reddit but I would rather inform some people that we have no say in the price and have the word spread.

I hired a moving company and when the final damage tally was added up I had two damaged fridges and one damaged carport gutter. One bar fridge was dropped by the mover (he was carrying it in his arms and dropped it a meter onto a hard tile floor). The main fridge was dented and scratched during the move due to them only putting a blanket on the top of the fridge but not protecting it's sides at all. They have denied all damage to the fridges, saying they took the upmost care. The carport gutter was damaged when they backed the moving truck into it. They want me to get a quote for the gutter and they will then \"discuss\" it with me. \n\nSince they have already lied I don't feel like they'll be fair in the \"discussion\".

I checked out a place recently but they didn't have one, although you can rent out a lift for an hour or something to make it easier. But yeah it seemed like it would be too small for some stuff like bed frames and mattress, which would mean just having to take several flights of stairs. If that's just how it is, then that's how it is, but if anyone knows if it's particularly common either way that'd be great, thanks.  \n  \nEdit: Thanks everyone for the replies, very useful to know.

They seem a bit dear but upon arriving at the venue, you get a chip worth $25 to invest in an enterprise. You can book [here](https://tickets.oztix.com.au/outlet/event/21aef638-ffe8-4437-9033-03749eec58d3?Event=92644) if you're interested.",

I have a Bachelors in Biomedical Science, and hold current qualifications in First Aid, & CPR, can perform data analysis using R, & GraphPad Prism, and am a quick learner. Unfortunately, I do not posses a driver's license (on a Vic learners still) and sadly neglected employment opportunities during previous years and have only worked in volunteer capacities in research labs. Would anyone have suggestions or recommendations as to how I should follow up? I have been applying for summer casual positions among others on the various job websites, tailoring my resume and CV as appropriate so far. Thanks for your time everyone.",

      "body":"Hi guys,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust looking for some advice I moved into a house in July and we received an electricity bill after 1 month (assuming it was to fall into their quarterly cycle). Anyway the bill was excessive ($250 for one month) Especially given that we only live in a 1 bed 1 bath unit with two of us. Even the bill outlines that our usage seemed excessive even for 4 people living in a house. Everything except the kettle and toaster were included in the rental so even if it is an appliance leaking that would be their responsibility right? Also we recently had the toilet fixed so part of me believes there could possible be a leak in the hot water system or something similar that is causing this issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway I have raised this with the real estate because I do not want to be liable to pay the next electricity bill (I paid this one already) however they have said that the landlord does not believe there is an issue and therefore will not be sending anyone out. Obviously I raised my concerns in regards to this to which the real estate said she will get back to me but she is not sure what else can be done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have contacted the RTA and I do know that I can issue a remedy of breach, however I also know that this will put me on the real estates bad side. So am holding off as a last resort.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I want to know is if anyone has been through this situation and how they fixed it? I have contacted the energy company and confirmed everything at my address was correct and they also noted that it was an actual meter read that generated this bill.\n\n  \nThey also went into T33 water and how it can cost a bit more to run, I asked them to do a break down on my bill if it was a lower hot water tier but that only fluctuated by around $5 so cannot see it being the reason my bill was so high.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for any help in advance!",
