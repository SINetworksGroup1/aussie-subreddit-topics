Any suggestions for what I could do to manage this sort of park visit extremely cheaply? \n\nOn a related note, if anyone is up for it, I'd be happy to pool in money, rent a car together and drive up to the national parks! If anyone's interested in something like this, you can reply here or DM me and we can catch up in the city, see if we'd survive a road trip together and work the rest out!",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nI am currently finishing a BMedSci at ANU, and intend to start pharmacy (BPharm) at CDU in semester 1, 2019. The course is 4 years long but since Ill have done a degree when I start, it will be 3 years with course credit. I am moving from Canberra and have previously lived in Darwin for 5 years growing up. Some questions below:\n\n\\-How much money should I have saved up (approx) when moving there before I find a job? Is it hard to find part time work (retail, pharmacy assistant etc, basically anything)?\n\n\\-What will the average rent be for a very basic single room studio/apartment? How does it compare to uni accomodation?\n\n\\-Im choosing CDU as I want to practice pharmacy in rural and remote parts of the country such as rural NT. Can I expect to get some placements in those areas?\n\nThats all for now. If you have any tips feel free to add them!\n\nThank you! :)",

    "title": "It's my 30 year anniversary of arriving in Darwin",
    "body": "A little write up I did when it was my 25th anniversary. \n\n25 years ago\nSo apparently today 09/04/2013 is the 25th anniversary of my arrival in Darwin NT. I guess that would have made me seven and a half years old when we left my home town of Melbourne.  \n\nI remember when we first moved here it was a three year plan and I hated that I was leaving my life and friends behind for something completely different.  \n\nI guess being seven helps though because it wasn\\u2019t long before I fell in love with Darwin and everything it had to offer. Darwin is an acquired taste and most the people who live here aren\\u2019t born here and in order to become a true local to you have to learn to love every part of it. The drunks, the stifling heat, the cool dry, the humidity, the lack of facilities, the crazy wildlife.\nYep I\\u2019m a local.    \n\nI was lucky enough that my family embraced Darwin whole-heartedly and I was thrown headfirst into becoming a bogan My father would drive us out to creeks in the middle of the night throwing all kinds of slippery creatures at us.   \n\nI would often wake up in the morning to find the bathtub full of snakes, turtles, crabs etc. Once my dad caught an unknown snake in our backyard. We were pretty used to this he would often drape three metre wild pythons around our necks as we grew up. He put the snake in a fish tank in the living room but there was something different about this one every time you walked past it would strike at you hitting the glass hard. After getting it identified we were all shocked to hear it was a brown \\u2013 The Third Deadliest Snake in the World. We used to catch lizards in the backyard name them and creating elaborate homes in random plastic tubs.    \n\nBut it wasn\\u2019t all slimy creatures. On Friday nights we would get fish & chips and head down to the cliffs on Nightcliff shoreline. We would watch the sunset over the jetty. Darwin has some of the best sunsets in the world. And if there was a cyclone incoming us girls would play in the huge waves as they crashed against the rocks. On Thursday nights mum would drag us down to the world famous \\u201cMindil Beach Markets\\u201d and we would sit on the beach eating lamb yiros watching the sun fall, finishing the night off with peppermint chocolate chip iceream.  \n\nIn Darwin no one would go to the city everyone would shop at Casuarina Shopping Centre smack bang in the middle of the suburbs and didn\\u2019t matter when you went you would always run into someone you knew. In the dry season we would head out to the National Parks back then Darwin was under developed so we could camp right next to the water and had no bathroom facilities but a small drop toilet. We would blow up inflatable beds and ride them all the way to the bottom of the rapids, the bruises we received all part of the adventure. Sometimes we would pack lunch and walk through the drain pipes in Rapid Creek.  \n\nIn Darwin you never wished for a white Christmas you always dreamed of a monsoonal Christmas, not to mention there wasn\\u2019t anything much better than snuggling deep into your bed on a rainy Sunday morning. As kids we would sit up in the high branches of a mango tree and talk into the early AM.  \n\nAt night we would climb up on top of the Mormon church taking blankets and pillows talking about everything. I had my first kiss on the roof of that church. My friends would come over after school and I would spend hours playing GoldenEye on the N64. Not to mention the glow bug wars that left us feeling destroyed.  \n\nIn Darwin it doesn\\u2019t matter if you forget your shoes when you go out & the singlet is the preferred clothing. You don\\u2019t swim in the ocean from September \\u2013 May and usually not any time after that. Everyone keeps their jackets at work because the air conditioning is freezing, speaking of freezing anything below 25C is considered cold. If you are supposed to be somewhere at 6pm you leave the house at 6 since everything is five-10 minutes away.  \n\nThey make us tough up here, dealing with frizzy hair and runny makeup on a daily basis you\\u2019d have to be. Do you think if I had grown up in Melbourne I would have been an urban city rat more interested in clothes & money than the wild bush person I am today. Who knows really who can say\\u2026 all I can say is I love Darwin with all my heart & I will always be a Territorian.  ",

    "title": "Discounts for unemployed and disabled Australians with Public Buses in Darwin and Alice Springs",
    "body": "If you are unemployed or disabled you could access the next discounts with Public Buses in Darwin and Alice Springs:\n\n(This is information that could useful for anyone here in this subreddit).\n\n--------\n\n**Discounts for unemployed Australians:**\n\nhttps://nt.gov.au/driving/public-transport-cycling/public-bus-tickets-and-fares/bus-fares-and-concessions\n\n**BENEFITS:** Concession fare: https://nt.gov.au/driving/public-transport-cycling/public-bus-tickets-and-fares/bus-fares-and-concessions\n\n**REQUIREMENTS:** \n\n* Health Care Card.\n\n(Full details in that web page).\n\n-------\n\n**Discounts for disabled Australians:**\n\nhttps://nt.gov.au/driving/public-transport-cycling/public-bus-tickets-and-fares/bus-fares-and-concessions\n\n**BENEFITS:** Concession fare: https://nt.gov.au/driving/public-transport-cycling/public-bus-tickets-and-fares/bus-fares-and-concessions\n\n**REQUIREMENTS:**\n\n* Pensioner Concession Card.\n\n(Full details in that web page).\n\n-------\n\nThere are many discounts that unemployed and disabled Australians can access. The Public Buses in Darwin and Alice Springs discount is just one of them. \n\nThe government has proposed a new legislation that will restrict access to these discounts. \n\nThat legislation is in the next link (this is the Explanatory memorandum) (I read in the news that Xenophon agreed to support that legislation, and that legislation can pass with his support):\n\nhttp://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/ems/r5927_ems_3e8c43b8-cfd4-4ef4-ae65-18fa97c11cdd/upload_pdf/646283_Revised%20EM.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf\n\nWhy? Because it will make it easy for unemployed and some disabled Australians to lose their payments. \n\nOnce they lose their payments, they will be unable to access the discounts anymore.\n\nLet me explain it:\n\nUnemployed Australians and some disabled Australians are required by law to do certain things, for example, to look for 10 jobs per week.\n\nThe new legislation will increase their requirements.\n\nBecause the requirements will increase, it will make it more likely that they will be unable to meet some of their requirements.\n\nIn the new legislation, the penalties for those who fail to do what they are required to do, will increase.\n\n(page 102)\n\n> To provide sufficient deterrence for wilfully non-compliant job seekers, the amount of the financial penalties will escalate with each additional failure and ultimately result in **cancellation  of  payment**.\n\nIn the media, the government has said that \"For a third failure, the job seeker\\u2019s payment will be cancelled\", but that is *FOR* the media, the legislation doesn't say that specifically.\n\nThe government is asking for a blank cheque about this issue, the government is asking parliament: \"give me unlimited power and I expect to do this, but you are not sure I will do that\", why? Because the government doesn't specify in the legislation what it precisely wants to do, for example:\n\nThe new legislation doesn't say \"For a third failure, the job seeker\\u2019s payment will be cancelled\", it doesn't say that, the government will take the decision in the future about what it want it to be, it could be that or could be different, we don't know, and that could change suddenly and without parliament approval. (That is shown in the page 204 of the [text of the proposed legislation](http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/bills/r5927_third-reps/toc_pdf/17147b01.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf))\n\n------\n\n**An easy way for Centrelink to cancel the payment in the new legislation:**\n\nIf a person is unable to go to an appointment, then that person will need to go to what is called a \"reconnection appointment\", if that person doesn't go to that \"reconnection appointment\" within 4 weeks then the payment will be cancelled:\n\n(page 110)\n\n> Subsection  42AM(3)  requires  the  Secretary  to  cancel  a  person\\u2019s  participation payment if the person does not comply with their reconnection requirement within 4 weeks    after  they  are  notified\n\nBut the person may not have received the notification, this is important to notice, this is VERY important, look what the government says in the new legislation:\n\n> Subsection  42AM(2)  obliges  the  Secretary  to  notify  the  person,  in  any  way  the Secretary considers appropriate, of the reconnection requirement\n\nSo, Centrelink will notify the person \"in  any  way  it considers appropriate\". \n\nIt says \"in  any  way\", that could mean: \n\n1. By text message or \n2. By e-mail or \n3. any other way, \n\nSo, there is uncertainty in which way that would be.\n\nAnd the person may **NOT** see that notification for some reason. \n\nAnd, this is VERY important: the new legislation **DOESN'T** require Centrelink to be sure that the person received the notification.\n\nI think this is unfair, and I think it disadvantages unemployed and disable Australians a lot, some of them may be homeless or live in unstable accommodation and it may be difficult for them to receive notifications.\n\nSo, this is big **loophole** in the new legislation.\n\nAnd there are lot of loopholes like that in the new legislation.\n\n------\n\nSo, because many unemployed and disabled Australians will have less access to discounts (because their payments will be cancelled for being unable to meet increased requirements), their lives will be more difficult, because they get paid very little money. They money they get paid will NOT increase with this legislation, for example, unemployed Australians get paid about $250 per week, $250 per week is very little money to live, that is why they get access to those discounts. \n\nSo, you will see a lot more people suffering.
