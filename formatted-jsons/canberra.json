Those conditions render the \u2018curb side service\u2019 useless and therefore not a service that a disabled passenger can rely upon.\n\nWhen challenged about the usefulness of their \u2018curb side service\u2019, their response was for the disabled passenger to ask a stranger for assistance. Like that is going to be successful at the airport at rush hour.\n\nBefore you comment, I have booked a car and driver to assist with luggage to the check-in counter and from the luggage carousel. \n\nWhy the airlines offer the \u2018curb side service\u2019 and set an expectation they clearly cannot meet.

      "title":"Kberra Bab Blog 10: Blazy's Bonus Round! Origin Turkish Kitchen (Iskender Kebab $24.70 and Baklava $8.50) A Bab and Bak review",
      "body":"*10 tasty bab reviews hangin' on the blog, 10 tasty bab reviews hangin' on the blog. I'm Blazy, and this review is gonna drop*.\n\nNow, I was thinking of something a bit special and settled on  the Iskender Kebab and Baklava, that's right! A bab and bak review! So, I didn't know what an Iskender Kebab was? I mean it has kabab in it, right? I asked my mate Sultan for a little background and he said it was bread covered by meat, sauce and yoghurt, like a Turkish nachos! \n\nI get to the restaurant, this is a restaurant similar to the Kababa near Civic bus-stop. It's got table cloths, cutlery, picture collages of Turkey and slightly too loud classical background music. It reminds me of those Italian family restaurants. I place an order and take a seat at a table, bit of a warning, you need to speak clearly and listen well to the waiter/chef so there's no misunderstandings. \n\nThe Iskender bab was turkish bread,butter, lamb kebab meat  tomato based sauce, yoghurt with tomato and parsley garnish. I didn't use my bab ruler this time, so no Bab measurements. The bread was Turkish bread, which meant the sauce was mopped up nicely. The bread was nice and not stale. The addition of the butter put the dish on the fatty side and I felt my eyes water a little, like when you eat KFC. The meat was shaved off the doner and grilled leaving a savory flavour and it wasn't too dry but it was overshadowed by the sauce. \n\nThe sauce was tomato, oregano, onion (fine chopped), garlic (I think powdered garlic) from what I could tell, though I would have liked some chili in there, lets get spicy! There was a lot of sauce, one saucy number! Although the sauciness is solved by the mopping ability of the Turkish bread. The additional sauce was yogurt which was quite nice, a little dairy to proceedings smoothing the tomato rich sauce, similar to sour cream on nachos.\n\nI'd have added some chili on top or put some chili in the sauce and would have spiced the meat as I was grilling it.  I would have also dialed back on the butter a little. \n\nNow, on to the bak (baklava) which is thin filo pastry layers with nuts and syrup/honey, like a sweet lasagna. They make their bak in store, good on them! I got two bak pieces, strawberries (no needles), some choccy ice cream and a drizzle of honey. I have little experience in bak reviews so I got this quote from a sixth generation bak maker in Turkey.  *\"The cracking sound is the sign of freshness, a sign of the finest  baklava; a must for us.\u00a0Good baklava leaves a heavenly taste in your mouth;\u00a0it shouldn\u2019t be very sweet and heavy; on the contrary it should  be light enough to tempt you to eat a small plateful.\u201d* I'll use this quote as the basis of my bak review.\n\nI got the crackling sound on the top part but not the lower layers, which could be because of the honey. The pastry had a nice savory buttery flavour, the nuts were peanut I think, and could have been a bit more tasty, I wondered about using pistachios instead. The honey was quite nice and gave a sweet touch. The sweetness especially on the bottom was a little overpowering sometimes, so I didn't eat the strawberries and ice cream. I think that the bak was sitting and taking in some of the honey, leading to the bottom being overly sweet\n\nSo, looking that the quote by the bak maker. It had a cracking sound but not in the bottom layers. The taste was a mix of buttery,savory and sweet. I'd say it was a little too sweet and slightly uneven and I wasn't tempted to eat more. \n\nFinally, let's look at prices. The price for the Iskender bab is $24.70 which is definitely too much, it fills you up but I wouldn't pay that much for it at all! The bak was $8.50 which I'd say is reasonable for what you get. I'd rate the Iskender bab a 2/5 an average review. It's a nice change from babs but it's too expansive for what I got taste wise. The bak I'd give a 3/5 an above average review, it was homemade and tasty but a bit too heavy and sweet to stand really stand out.\n\nThanks for being with me on my 10th review my fine Bab Brigade. I have enjoyed doing these reviews and I like the discussion that grows from them. \n\nThanks all. \n\nBlazy, \n\nNote: [https://ozlemsturkishtable.com/2013/07/baklava-101-from-the-masters-tips-to-make-the-real-thing-at-home/](https://ozlemsturkishtable.com/2013/07/baklava-101-from-the-masters-tips-to-make-the-real-thing-at-home/) This is the site I got the quote from! \n\n[Out the front](https://i.redd.it/lkqq74yigqq11.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The restaurant](https://i.redd.it/vzbf2kr0hqq11.jpg)\n\n \n\n[Iskender Bab](https://i.redd.it/70aoshzshqq11.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bak](https://i.redd.it/1hgtsk6biqq11.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bak nut layer](https://i.redd.it/jwvfowczkqq11.jpg)",

The enterance is not discreet at all, and due to Fyshwicks status as a mini red light district at night and generally busy anyway throughout the day do not expect privacy going in and out.\n\nACTPG are really busy at night time, however they do a good job at staggering arriving clients and placing them in individual waiting rooms as to avoid awkwardness, Complimentary drink of your choice is also provided.\n\nThe ladies are very lovely, and ACTPG boasts a large roster of ladies to choose from so even on a busy night you're guaranteed to have a good selection.\n\nThe ladies look young, all the ladies looked to be around 25 or younger. Not a lot of variety in age which depending on your taste is either good or bad. \n\nThe room itself was spacious, clean and at a nice temperature, there were no electrical issues at all with the lights but the shower had a really sensitive tap, it was hard to set the water to a comfortable temperature.\n\nThe bed was comfy and not noisy at all, however the walls were not soundproofed so I could hear other clients in other rooms, The ladies play music to counter this.\n\nAll in all, a satisfactory experience. 8/10\n\nNext time I'll be visiting Mitchell so stay tuned for my next post\n\n\n",

      "body":"*His palms are sweaty, hands full, meat is heavy. There's sauce on this face already: Yarra's Ke-babby!*\n\nHi Bab brigade! It's Blazy here with another review for you. The review is.....  You guessed it, Yarra babs! There's been songs, requests and everyone mentions it when you talk about it on the street, so I decided to take the plunge. I rocking up at Friday at 6:45pm before the long weekend, what a way to kick things off!\n\nI walk in and there's about 20-25 people in there, it lives up to it's reputation! They have an area where you fill out what you want on your bab and then you hand it to the staff, some of the OB's (original babbers) showed me how it's done. I got a lamb kebab roll with lettuce, tomato, onion, tabbouleh, cheese, chili sauce and humus, loadin up. As they made my bab I looked around, they were carving and storing it in a bain-marie and using it quickly, they also toasted the bab to finish. \n\nI went outside and measured it to 8cm width, one of the bigger ones so far, serious girth. The bab was very well wrapped, so well wrapped, it was straight out of Compton! I had to unwind it ,bit by bit, bite by bite and there was no spillage at all. You look at the bab you see meat, meat and more meat. The meat is quite satisfying and has a nice savory flavour to it, although it is on the fatty side. It's the good kind of fatty, like crackling and it wasn't under cooked at all. \n\nThe veggies and cheese were ok, though I recommend getting the tabbouleh as the sharp parsley flavour really helps to balance out the meaty fattiness nicely. There's definitely a high amount of meat to the veggies, I reckon a bit more veggies wouldn't go a miss but I respect their commitment to meat. The sauce is there and is tasty but the chili was a little sparse, they may be intentionally going sparse to showcase the meat or catering to local tastes but I wanted more chili! \n\nThis meaty bab will definitely fill you up and it is fair value compared to other babs. They do have a $15 EFTPOS limit but they waved that with me, so just be aware of that if you pay by card. I like the place,  it reminds me of a suburban pizza joint though with a hearty dose of Turkish flair. \n\nNow, this review was challenging, very challenging for me. I was torn between 3-4 stars. The bab is generous meat wise, well wrapped and fills you up nicely. The veggies balance things out but more would make i just right. The sparse chili sauce is an issue, a good coverage of sauce is a must. Overall,the bab is about 3.5 but the atmosphere, the look and feel was exciting and it was nice to see fellow babbers in there.  I will give it a 4/5 because of the whole package. I saw that they had chili paste and I should have added that to the mix. This is a solid kebab all round and I'd be up for another review of this one in less busy circumstances to see if the sauce issues are dealt with. \n\nBlazy's note: I'd be up for a couple more reviews here to work out consistency, busy vs not busy and also how lax they are about the EFTPOS limit, as a $15 limit will force you to get a drink. I was conscious of the hype factor and It'd be good to try it a second time to see how it holds up to this review. \n\nSee ya! \n\nBlazy, \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The outside!

I made a few videos 2 years ago, for Aussie 3D, he wanted a few videos where he ranked 3D printers and it was essentially a promotional video to advertise his company. Some sound work was required to clean up and also sync audio from multiple sources. Nothing too crazy in the editing, just clean cuts and transitions, and a professional feel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only work I've done since is for my own personal videos, which is me talking in front of a camera, with a green screen behind me. In terms of editing, I use Sony Vegas 15 and Izotope to clean up audio. I have yet to do any animation work, such as in Blender. I use GIMP to edit photos.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI understand most of my videos are fairly basic in terms of what editing is required, but I am more than willing to learn how to use both Photoshop and Adobe Premier/After Effects, but obviously this would take a bit of time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGiven all that, I don't expect to get full time work immediately, and would be happy to do part time/casual work while I build up the required skills.

I got myself a large lamb bab with lettuce, tomato, onion, carrot  and chili and tomato sauces. The large lamb bab came with two sauces, so I loaded up, cause I'm a saucy one!\n\nI chomped this bab in my car, so get your fluffy dice out! I whipped out the bab ruler and measured 7cm in diameter, though the bab was flattened, why? The bab was toasted, which flattened it panini style with a golden brown  \nhue to boot . The toasting meant that the bab didn't fall apart and was pleasantly hot, but at a cost. The veggies were a little wilted from the heat and lacked good fresh flavour,especially the lettuce. The carrot was an interesting addition and added bit of sweetness to the proceedings. I got only small shavings of onion and I wanted more.\n\nNow, the meat was pre-carved and from a metal bain-marie, which makes sense as it was 2.00pm on a Saturday. The meat wasn't dry nor fatty and was heated by the warm wrap, but I couldn't taste much of it at all, more to come. The meat ratio to veggies was OK, though I would have liked more fresh veggies in the mix. I had two sauces which were chili and tomato. The sauces rounded each other nicely because the tomato softened the heat of the chili. Though the sauce did overpower the meat flavour and I didn't notice much meat flavour. The sauce wasn't runny,no spill and was evenly distributed through the bab. \n\nThe price was $9.50 which is not as much as some of the others out there, being under $10 and was relatively filling considering what you get. The bab is a 2/5 because of the meat, veggie and sauce issues though the price from what I've seen from of other kebabs in my reviews, is more reasonable which makes it a 3/5, so a 3/5 (for pricing sake).  In my mind a good kebab should fill you up and be affordable. \n\nThough what would you think about price vs taste? Do you take this into account? Something for the Bab Brigade to discuss! Or if you don't want to talk about money, try this!  Is toasting the outside of the bab good for you or not?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Store front](https://i.redd.it/4638w64duyn11.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2 free sauces also lamb is cheaper than chicken?](https://i.redd.it/k0jnwes3wyn11.jpg)\n\n[Check out the toasting and also the slightly wilted lettuce ](https://i.redd.it/ddr0me01vyn11.jpg)\n\n[Bitten bab](https://i.redd.it/zdfzduytuyn11.jpg)",
