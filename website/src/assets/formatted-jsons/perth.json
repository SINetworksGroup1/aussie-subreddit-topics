They would have opened the back door and grabbed the first item they saw which would have been the laptop on the dining table. We were sleeping upstairs. Nothing else was taken (thankfully) but it was still an awful feeling waking up to notice your laptop was gone. It was my girlfriends laptop. She was staying here whilst we studied for an upcoming exam the next day. Neither of us have contents insurance - and this is a life lesson to get it. \n\nWe filled a report straight away in the morning when we found out. Police came with Forensics to look at our place but couldn't really find any viable fingerprints. \n\nAbout half an hour later - the 'Find My Phone' app started pinging a location to a house/set of houses a couple of blocks away. We called the Police and they were down there in minutes. Apparently they looked everywhere the laptop was pinging to at the time, but couldn't find anything. There are a set of apartments in that area that apparently get regular attention from the Police for various reasons, but they are unable to do anything without a search warrant. \n\nThe laptop hasn't pinged since. There is a lock on the laptop which prevents anyone from getting into the account but I suspected they have been using the guest log in to connect to the WiFi. \n\nIt's very frustrating being able to localise the item to a set of apartments and still not being able to do anything. \n\nAside from getting contents insurance (to protect from this happening again) - is there anything else we can do for this? Anyone out there with a similar experience?",

Main event venue - To cater for roughly 200 people, a large live band, wooden floor. Traditionally these have been formal/semi-formal nights held in town halls (eg. Perth, North Perth) \n\n2. Late night venue - Would cater for about 80 or so people, possibly a small live band, wooden floors, kitchen preferred, and preferably two rooms for differing tempos. Seeking a casual venue that will keep its door open until the early morning. Examples in the past have been studio spaces or smaller community halls.\n\nIdeally we'd also like to keep them as geographically central as possible, but are open to travelling. So if anyone has experience booking these types of venues, especially for other dance scenes, I'd love to hear from you. Thanks!",

Due to the nature of working for a small business as a manager it has been really difficult for me to even consider taking off an extended period of time. Which has led to me accruing another 300hours total of holiday pay on top of my already 8 weeks long service leave. \n\nI\u2019m planning on quitting this job (finally!) this week and have another job lined up to begin after my 4 weeks of required notice. \n\nI was just wondering what options do I have in regards to all this leave I am owed? Obviously I am going to have to be paid out, but can i put it into super without being taxed to hell? I know that the company I work for won\u2019t be able to afford to pay me one lump sum so I feel as though I will be earning two salaries at once and it may push me into a higher tax bracket?\n\nDoes anyone have a solution to my problem or a recommendation on what I should do?\n\nThanks!",

      "title":"[Sob Story] I'm desperate for any advice on how to manage an Australian passport issue for a friend",
      "body":"I wouldn't normally ask about this kind of thing because I know it's a very long shot and there's most likely nothing that anybody can do or advise me to do better, but I'm desperate for even a shred of hope. Normally I'm the sort to keep the serious stuff to myself, but this is kind of a long and sad story as well, so I apologize in advance for that.\n\nI have a friend with a brother with a physical disability who is confined to an electric wheelchair. He's been fascinated with Japan all his life, he loves everything about it. My friends father passed away when she was young, and the mother is an unstable alcoholic who primarily cares for the brother. The family has never had much money.\n\nMy friend has worked really hard for over a year to save up enough money to surprise her brother with a trip to Japan last Christmas, and he was so excited when she told him. They planned out the whole trip together for a couple weeks, arranged a carer to accompany them, and booked the trip. However, she didn't know or anticipate the issues she'd have getting him a passport, and while that is like step zero of planning a holiday overseas, *before* you book anything, she'd never traveled before, nor could anyone have expected the issues they would have. Still, it was a mistake, she acknowledges that.\n\nThe brother, who was born after August '86, needs to have a parent's Australian birth certificate in order to get his passport. The father was born in England, and the mother was born in Malaysia, has no drivers license or photo ID. The brother was born in Australia, but obviously has no drivers license. My friend has tried so hard to get her mother to fulfill the requirements of the brothers passport, but she refuses to do so. Every opportunity she gets, she undermines my friends efforts. My friend has given her money to go to and get some kind of photo ID, which she gambled at the TAB and spent on booze. She promises my friend that she will do what she needs to, but then does the exact opposite. She makes innumerable excuses to avoid doing what she should do. Her motivations are selfish and deluded, she can't be reasoned with.\n\nAfter the flight dates began approaching in June, her mother promised that she would do what her requirements were, and my friend rebooked the flights for late October at considerable expense. She assured my friend that she was working on it. After an argument last night it came out that the mother had still made no effort to help her son get his passport. I'm convinced she never will, or even if she did, it's now too late.\n\nMy friend is absolutely crushed, she took every dollar she could spare and put it towards this gift for her brother, and on account of her mother, it's all been completely squandered. I don't know much about the whole process when it comes to foreign born parents, but I know the mother has basically no ID at all. I've tried to help her every way I can, I've spent hours on the phone with various govt agencies trying to find a way to get his passport without the mother's input, but none of them can offer anything useful. My friend seems like she's lost all hope now, whenever we start to talk about what we might need or be able to do to get around it, she'll just start crying, I'm sure she's tried everything.\n\nI've been through every standard, official channel I know of, I've outlined this story to people on the phone and in person at various departments, none of them seem to be able to help. I'm looking for any advice at all on this preferably from people who work with passport applications or have in the past, or anyone who might know of a way to make it happen, could perhaps give guidance to my friend, or anything. If it's a matter of money, then I can afford it. If there is a consultancy fee that's needed, then I can handle that. If there are palms that need greasing, then I have grease. If there's any leverage at all that can be gotten on such a thing on any level, then just point me in the right direction. If you're thinking of googling this problem, know that I've already been well beyond page ten, and it's pretty bleak back there.\n\nIt might be possible to get this sorted out with more time and I'd book them new flights afterwards, but if October 28th comes around and her brother doesn't have a passport, then after all her time and effort and money, twice making the promise and asserting that no matter what, she'd make it happen, my friend with the kindest and most resilient soul I've ever known will be hurt so deeply and unfairly that I can't even think about it without crying myself. Like I said, I know this is an extremely long shot, but I've gotta try. If anyone knows anyone who might be able to help, please let me know.",
